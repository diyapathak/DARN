# DARN
  This is a Chrome Extension to help detect Spoilers. To use this extension, clone all of these files (using the clone button) into a folder on your desktop. Go to chrome://extensions/ on your google search engine and turn on developer mode. Click the "Load Unpacked" button which should open up all of your folders. Select the folder with all of the cloned files and open it (with the open button). There should now be a little button in the upper right corner next to the search engine with all the content of our extension. Enjoy!
